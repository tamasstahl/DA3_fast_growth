# DA3_fast_growth

This is the repository for Data Analysis 3 assignment 2 regarding the bisnode_firm dataset. My task was to build a model to predict fast growth of firms.

PART I: Probability prediction
Predict probabilities
Look at cross-validated performance and pick your favorite model

PART II: Classification
Think about the business problem, and define your loss function (like FP=3, FN=7)
For each model, predict probabilities, look for the optimal classification threshold, calculate expected loss with your loss function. 
Pick the model that has the smallest average (over 5 folds) expected loss

PART III Discussion of results
Show a confusion table (on a selected fold or holdout set)
Discuss results, evaluate how useful your model may be
